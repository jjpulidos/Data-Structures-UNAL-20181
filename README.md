- The first option and the second options of the menu show submenus for each array (array 1 and array 2), the submenu show the following options:

	- Define the length of the array
	- Add elements to the array
	- Delete an element (index) in the array
	- Add an empty space (index) in the array
	- Back

- The third option of the menu show a submenu with the following operations:

	- Sum of the arrays (sum of each component of the arrays)
	- Substraction of the arrays (sub of each component of the arrays)
	- Product of the arrays (multiply of each component of the arrays)
	- Factorial of the array (the factorial of each component of the first array)
	- Fibonacci of the array with memoization (the fibonacci of each component of the first array)
	- Back

#### How to run:

- The main class is called Taller1 just run with your favorite IDE.

#### How to run:

- The main class is called Main (The GUI part of this code was developed on intellij idea IDE), you should run it on intellij idea IDE for no posible errors.



### Taller 4

#### Stack Simulator

The purposal of the following code is learn about Stack as a Data Structure

The steps for the code are in the following picture:

![stack01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25142388/42120484-3480ec6c-7be1-11e8-9857-b22f68518107.PNG)


- How many stacks the user going to use? (from 1 to 10)
- How the stack will be filled)? (begin from bottom to top, A-Z preferencial order added)
- Enter a Letter for print the distance between the top and the letter.

#### How to run:

- The main class is called Main just run with your favorite IDE.



### Taller 5

- How many persons will play the game?
- For each player choose a color.
- The play begin and randomly choose a winner.

#### How to run:

- The main class is called Main just run with your favorite IDE.



## Max Heap

Pseudocode Implemented in Java of the Data Structures Course by Universidad de California en San Diego & National Research University Higher School of Economics (Coursera)

#### How to run:

- The Data structure class is called MaxHeap and we can run a Test class called MaxHeapTest provided by the Teacher of the course.

- The Test class run on JUnit 4 Test Library.



## Disjoint Set

Pseudocode Implemented in Java of the Data Structures Course by Universidad de California en San Diego & National Research University Higher School of Economics (Coursera)

#### How to run:

- The Data structure class is called DisjointSet and we can run a Test class called DisjointSetTest provided by the Teacher of the course.

- The Test class run on JUnit 4 Test Library.


## Rabin Karp Algorithm

Pseudocode Implemented in Java of the Data Structures Course by Universidad de California en San Diego & National Research University Higher School of Economics (Coursera)

- The Algorithm Rabin Karp is based on Hashing technique, the main class is called Main and evaluate how many strings of the pattern input match with the text (in my case Don quijote Book).

#### How to run:

- Run the Main class

- Input the number of patterns to search

- Write the Patterns separated by Enter

- Wait to Rabin Karp results
