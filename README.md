- The first option and the second options of the menu show submenus for each array (array 1 and array 2), the submenu show the following options:

	- Define the length of the array
	- Add elements to the array
	- Delete an element (index) in the array
	- Add an empty space (index) in the array
	- Back

- The third option of the menu show a submenu with the following operations:

	- Sum of the arrays (sum of each component of the arrays)
	- Substraction of the arrays (sub of each component of the arrays)
	- Product of the arrays (multiply of each component of the arrays)
	- Factorial of the array (the factorial of each component of the first array)
	- Fibonacci of the array with memoization (the fibonacci of each component of the first array)
	- Back
